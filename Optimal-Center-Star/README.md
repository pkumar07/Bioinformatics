# Optimal-Center-Star
The main idea of this paper is to provide a improvised version of Center star algorithm with an advantage of achieving better run time as it makes use of concepts like keyword tree and sliding window to align matched regions. It uses Global Alignment (Needleman Wunsch - dynamic programming) algorithm only to align mismatched sequences, thereby saving a lot of time involved in rather aligning entire sequence by dynamic programming.
